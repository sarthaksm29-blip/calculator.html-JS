This is a simple calculator built using HTML and JavaScript that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator works by allowing users to click on number buttons (0–9) and operator buttons (+, −, *, /), which are then displayed on the screen. When the equals (=) button is clicked, the entered expression is evaluated and the result is shown. The project uses basic DOM manipulation and event listeners to handle user interactions and update the result dynamically. It is designed as a beginner-friendly practice project to understand JavaScript logic, event handling, and how HTML elements interact with JavaScript.
